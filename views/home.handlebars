        <p>As a <img id="spiced" src="/assets/SPICED.png" alt="spiced">-ling,
            now I tend to spend many hours sitting and coding... don't get me wrong, I enjoy (most of) it,
         but I'm used to much more physical activity and for that reason I believe biking to and from school is the best.
